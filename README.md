PyPacking is a **package manager** and installer for Python designed to be **interactive and user-friendly**. With easy operation, you can install *packages and tools*.

## How to install

surprisingly, we use PyPacking itself to perform its own installation. You just need to run the script from the `install` file and that's it, installed.

To install `PyPacking` on your machine (only **Linux** support), follow the steps below:

1. Clone the official PyPacking repository using `git` or by downloading in zip:

```
git clone git@github.com:jaedsonpys/pypacking.git
```

2. Go to the project **root** and run the available `install` file:

```
./install
```

> If you are using a virtual environment, PyPacking will be installed there.
